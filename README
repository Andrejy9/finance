# Finance

## Overview
This project is a **finance management system** built with Python, Node.js, and MongoDB, designed to track and analyze a customizable list of financial tickers.  
In the future, the software will autonomously manage a portfolio of assets with advanced features such as automatic ticker evaluation and classification, backtesting of machine learning models, and experimentation with Quantum Machine Learning (QML).  
All these components aim to optimize portfolio allocation, suggest entry and exit strategies, and ultimately maximize profitability.

At the moment, historical data is downloaded launching manually the test.py script, but the system is already structured to support automatic data collection using scraping scripts and rotating API keys (to be developed).

Upcoming features include real-time market data scraping, deeper fundamental analysis, and AI-powered analytics. Looking ahead, the platform is designed to be flexible and forward-looking, with plans to experiment with advanced techniques like Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to further improve forecasting and decision-making.

## Features
- **Multi-database support**: Uses multiple MongoDB databases to manage data.
- **Duplicate prevention**: Ensures that the same ticker is not saved multiple times.
- **REST API endpoints**: Provides endpoints for saving and retrieving ticker information.
- **Scalability**: Designed to support additional features like **AI-driven trading insights** and **automated risk management**.


### Current Architecture

1. **Frontend (JavaScript, under development)**:
   - A browser-based interface for managing tickers, viewing historical data, and triggering analytics.
   - Communicates with the backend via REST API endpoints.

2. **Backend (Node.js & Python)**:
   - The Node.js layer handles routing, user interactions, and database operations (MongoDB).
   - Python modules are invoked for heavy data processing and AI-related computations.
   - Communication between Node.js and Python occurs via child processes or HTTP calls using local endpoints 

   
3. **Database (MongoDB)**:
| Database             | Contenuto principale                                |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `tickers`            | Ticker salvati e configurazioni utente             |
| `finance`            | Dati principali utente (preferiti, cronologia, ecc.)|
| `finance_historical` | Prezzi storici giornalieri per ogni ticker         |
| `weeklyPrices`       | Prezzi settimanali dei titoli                      |
| `fundamentalsDB`     | Bilanci, dividendi e dati fondamentali             |

### Planned Enhancements
- **AI & Machine Learning Integration**:
  - Implement **neural networks** and **predictive models** for trading insights.
  - Analyze **holder distribution patterns** and **price movement trends**.
- **Automated Trading Logic**:
  - Utilize **indicators like ATR** for risk management.
  - Develop a **smart bot** capable of making trading decisions.

## Future Roadmap
- ✅ Implement Ticker Storage and API
- ✅ Implement historical price data download from web
- ⏳ Implement other scraping logics (news, recent tweets)
- ⏳ AI Model for Predicting Market Trends
- ⏳ Automated Trading Bot


## TODO
- Scrape data from https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&ty=c&ta=1&p=d (low priority)
- Normalize financial data and structure it into historical time series to make it suitable for ingestion by machine learning systems
- Implement a classification machine learning algorithm to categorize tickers based on volatility and risk levels
