# Personal Finance

## Overview
This project is a **Python and Node.js, MongoDB-based finance management system** designed to monitor a customizable number of tickers. Future implementations will include historical data downloads, web scraping for real-time market insights, and fundamental analysis. These enhancements, combined with AI-driven analytics, will support medium-term investment decision-making.

## Features
- **Multi-database support**: Uses multiple MongoDB databases (`finance`, `tickers`) to manage ticker data.
- **Duplicate prevention**: Ensures that the same ticker is not saved multiple times.
- **REST API endpoints**: Provides endpoints for saving and retrieving ticker information.
- **Scalability**: Designed to support additional features like **AI-driven trading insights** and **automated risk management**.

## Architecture
The system follows a **modular architecture**, making it extensible for future AI and trading logic enhancements.

### Current Architecture
1. **Frontend (under development)**:
   - Will provide a UI for interacting with the finance system.


2. **Backend (Node.js, Express, Python)**:
   - Handles API requests for saving and retrieving tickers.
   - Prevents duplicate entries before insertion.
   - Manages database connections dynamically.

3. **Database (MongoDB)**:
   - `tickers` database: Stores market data for various tickers.
   - `finance` database: Manages user-specific saved tickers.

### Planned Enhancements
- **AI & Machine Learning Integration**:
  - Implement **neural networks** and **predictive models** for trading insights.
  - Analyze **holder distribution patterns** and **price movement trends**.
- **Automated Trading Logic**:
  - Utilize **indicators like ATR** for risk management.
  - Develop a **smart bot** capable of making trading decisions.
